# Brightness Controller

It supports an arbitrary number of displays and also allows changing the color temperature across displays!

## Features

The following features are implemented:

1. Brightness Control
1. Saving color profile
1. Loading color profile

Brightness Controller changes Red, Green and Blue color ratios  in the screen through color profile at software level using `xrandr`.

We might implement the following features in the future:

1. Rewriting GUI to integrate both Brightness Controller simple and normal
2. Auto-loading of color and brightness settings based on profile
3. Checking for update

We work on this in our spare time, so can not really promise when the v3 will be released. The current version available is stable and should work as intended.
