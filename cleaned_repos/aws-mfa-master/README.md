aws-mfa: Easily manage your AWS Security Credentials when using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
=================================================================================================

**aws-mfa** makes it easy to manage your AWS SDK Security Credentials when Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced on your AWS account. It automates the process of obtaining temporary credentials from the AWS Security Token Service and updating your AWS Credentials file (located at `~/.aws/credentials`). Traditional methods of managing MFA-based credentials requires users to write their own bespoke scripts/wrappers to fetch temporary credentials from STS and often times manually update their AWS credentials file.

The concept behind **aws-mfa** is that there are 2 types of credentials:

* `long-term` - Your typcial AWS access keys, consisting of an `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

* `short-term` - A temporary set of credentials that are generated by AWS STS using your `long-term` credentials in combination with your MFA device serial number (either a hardware device serial number or virtual device ARN) and one time token code. Your short term credentials are the credentials that are actively utilized by the AWS SDK in use.
