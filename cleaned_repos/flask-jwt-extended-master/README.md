# Flask-JWT-Extended

### Features

Flask-JWT-Extended not only adds support for using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to Flask for protecting routes,
but also many helpful (and **optional**) features built in to make working with JSON Web Tokens
easier. These include:

-   Adding custom claims to JSON Web Tokens
-   Automatic user loading (`current_user`).
-   Custom claims validation on received tokens
-   Refresh tokens
-   First class support for fresh tokens for making sensitive changes.
-   Token revoking/blocklisting
-   Storing tokens in cookies and CSRF protection
