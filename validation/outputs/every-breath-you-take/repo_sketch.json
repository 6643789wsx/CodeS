This application allows you to measure and train this effect with a Polar H10 Heart Rate monitor.\n\nHeart rate variability, the small changes in heart rate from beat-to-beat, is a reliable measure of stress response. Heart rate variability reflects the balance between the two sides of the autonomic nervous system: the fight-or-flight response (from the sympathetic nervous system) and the rest-and-digest response (from the parasympathetic nervous system).\n\nIn any moment it is possible to restore balance to the autonomic nervous system by breathing slower and deeper. With every breath you take, you can set the pace of your breathing rate, measure your breathing control with the chest accelerometer, and see how heart rate variability responds.\n\n## Features\n\n- Connect and stream from a Polar H10, acceleration and heart rate data\n- Live breathing control feedback and adjustable pace setting\n- Track breathing and heart rate oscillations in real-time\n- Explore how heart rate vairability repsonses to different breathing rates\n\n## Installation and usage\n\nWorks with Polar H10, with Firmware Version 5.0.0 or later\n    \n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `my_project_env\\Scripts\\activate`\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    python EBYT.py \n\nBundle into an application with pyinstaller:\n\n    pyinstaller EBYT.spec\n\nThe program will automatically connect to your Polar device.
