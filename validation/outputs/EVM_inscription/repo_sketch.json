It streamlines the process of connecting to various blockchain networks and automates the submission of multiple transactions.\n\n## Features\n- **Multiple Blockchain Support**: Compatible with several EVM blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.\n- **Dynamic Configuration**: Customize the number of inscriptions, transaction data, and gas pricing.\n- **Secure Private Key Handling**: Ensures the safe usage of your private key without hardcoding it in the script.\n- **User-Friendly**: Simple setup and execution process.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore using this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n## Setup\n1. **Private Key**: For security reasons, do not hardcode your private key in the script. Instead, use an environment variable or a secure key management system.\n2. **RPC URL**: Choose the appropriate RPC URL for the blockchain you intend to interact with.\n3. **Configuration**:\n   - `no_to_mint`: Set the number of inscriptions you wish to create.\n   - `hex_data`: Provide the hexadecimal data for the inscription.\n   - `price_factor`: Adjust the gas price factor according to network conditions.\n\n## Usage\n1. Open the script and enter the required configuration parameters.\n2. Run the script from your terminal:\n   ```\n   python evm_inscription.py\n   ```",
