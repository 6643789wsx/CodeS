The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nCurrent File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `pygraft/class_generator.py`.\n\n```python\nimport copy\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pygraft.utils_schema import *\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n\nclass ClassGenerator:\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        pass\n\n    def init_params(self, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the parameters for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n            kwargs (dict): The keyword arguments.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def init_class_structures(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the class structures for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a class schema based on the given parameters.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def assemble_class_info(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Assembles and returns information about the current class schema.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        \"\"\"TODO\"\"\"\n\n    def generate_classes(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates the classes for the given self instance based on the\n        given number of classes.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_hierarchy(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generate the class hierarchy for the given self instance.\n        This function creates a hierarchical structure of classes based on the\n        existing classes in the self instance.

PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nCurrent File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `pygraft/class_generator.py`.\n\n```python\nimport copy\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pygraft.utils_schema import *\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n\nclass ClassGenerator:\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        pass\n\n    def init_params(self, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the parameters for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n            kwargs (dict): The keyword arguments.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def init_class_structures(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the class structures for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a class schema based on the given parameters.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def assemble_class_info(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Assembles and returns information about the current class schema.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_classes(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates the classes for the given self instance based on the\n        given number of classes.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_hierarchy(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generate the class hierarchy for the given self instance.\n        This function creates a hierarchical structure of classes based on the\n        existing classes in the self instance.

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nCurrent File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `pygraft/class_generator.py`.\n\n```python\nimport copy\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pygraft.utils_schema import *\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n\nclass ClassGenerator:\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        pass\n\n    def init_params(self, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the parameters for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n            kwargs (dict): The keyword arguments.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def init_class_structures(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the class structures for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a class schema based on the given parameters.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def assemble_class_info(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Assembles and returns information about the current class schema.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_classes(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates the classes for the given self instance based on the\n        given number of classes.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_hierarchy(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generate the class hierarchy for the given self instance.\n        This function creates a hierarchical structure of classes based on the\n        existing classes in the self instance.

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nCurrent File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `pygraft/class_generator.py`.\n\n```python\nimport copy\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pygraft.utils_schema import *\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n\nclass ClassGenerator:\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        pass\n\n    def init_params(self, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the parameters for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n            kwargs (dict): The keyword arguments.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def init_class_structures(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the class structures for the class generator.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a class schema based on the given parameters.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def assemble_class_info(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Assembles and returns information about the current class schema.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            class_info (dict): A dictionary containing various information about the class.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_classes(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates the classes for the given self instance based on the\n        given number of classes.\n\n        Args:\n            self (object): The instance of the ClassGenerator.\n\n        Returns:\n            None\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def generate_class_hierarchy(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generate the class hierarchy for the given self instance.\n        This function creates a hierarchical structure of classes based on the\n        existing classes in the self instance.

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nRelevant File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `setup.py`.\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\nwith open(\"README.md\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf8\") as fh:\n    long_description = fh.read()\nsetup(\n    name=\"pygraft\",\n    version=\"0.0.3\",\n    packages=find_packages(exclude=\"docs\"),\n    include_package_data=True,\n    zip_safe=False,\n    package_data={\n        \"pygraft\": [\n            \"examples/template.json\",\n            \"examples/template.yml\",\n            \"property_checks/combinations.json\",\n            \"property_checks/compat_p1p2_inverseof.txt\",\n        ]\n    },\n    entry_points={\"console_scripts\": [\"pygraft = pygraft.main:main\"]},\n    license=\"MIT\",\n    description=\"PyGraft: Configurable Generation of Schemas and Knowledge Graphs at Your Fingertips\",\n    author=\"Nicolas Hubert\",\n    author_email=\"nicolas.hubert@univ-lorraine.fr\",\n    url=\"https://github.com/nicolas-hbt\",\n    long_description=long_description,\n    long_description_content_type=\"text/markdown\",\n    keywords=[\n        \"Knowledge Graph\",\n        \"Ontology\",\n        \"Schema\",\n        \"Semantic Web\",\n        \"Synthetic Data Generator\",\n    ],\n    install_requires=[\n        \"numpy>=1.24.0\",\n        \"matplotlib>=3.7.0\",\n        \"Owlready2>=0.41\",\n        \"rdflib>=6.2.0\",\n        \"pyyaml\",\n        \"tabulate\",\n        \"art\",\n        \"tqdm\",\n    ],\n    python_requires=\">=3.7\",\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Development Status :: 4 -

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nRelevant File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `setup.py`.\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\nwith open(\"README.md\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf8\") as fh:\n    long_description = fh.read()\nsetup(\n    name=\"pygraft\",\n    version=\"0.0.3\",\n    packages=find_packages(exclude=\"docs\"),\n    include_package_data=True,\n    zip_safe=False,\n    package_data={\n        \"pygraft\": [\n            \"examples/template.json\",\n            \"examples/template.yml\",\n            \"property_checks/combinations.json\",\n            \"property_checks/compat_p1p2_inverseof.txt\",\n        ]\n    },\n    entry_points={\"console_scripts\": [\"pygraft = pygraft.main:main\"]},\n    license=\"MIT\",\n    description=\"PyGraft: Configurable Generation of Schemas and Knowledge Graphs at Your Fingertips\",\n    author=\"Nicolas Hubert\",\n    author_email=\"nicolas.hubert@univ-lorraine.fr\",\n    url=\"https://github.com/nicolas-hbt\",\n    long_description=long_description,\n    long_description_content_type=\"text/markdown\",\n    keywords=[\n        \"Knowledge Graph\",\n        \"Ontology\",\n        \"Schema\",\n        \"Semantic Web\",\n        \"Synthetic Data Generator\",\n    ],\n    install_requires=[\n        \"numpy>=1.24.0\",\n        \"matplotlib>=3.7.0\",\n        \"Owlready2>=0.41\",\n        \"rdflib>=6.2.0\",\n        \"pyyaml\",\n        \"tabulate\",\n        \"art\",\n        \"tqdm\",\n    ],\n    python_requires=\">=3.7\",\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Development Status :: 4 -

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)",

The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.\n\nBeing able to synthesize schemas and KGs is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500

PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. \n\nPyGraft has the following features:\n- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both\n- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters\n- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs\n- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)\n\n---\nRepository Sketch\n---\nHere is a practicable repository sketch.\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 source\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500 conf.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pygraft\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 class_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 kg_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # from pygraft import (;\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 pygraft.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 relation_generator.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema_constructor.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 utils_kg.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils_schema.py\n```\n\n---\nCurrent File Sketch/1\n---\nHere is the file sketch of `pygraft/utils.py`.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\nimport pathlib\nimport pickle\nimport random\nimport shutil\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pkg_resources\nimport yaml\nfrom art import *\nfrom owlready2 import *\n\nfont_styles = [\"dancingfont\", \"rounded\", \"varsity\", \"wetletter\", \"chunky\"]\n\n\ndef print_ascii_header():\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\ndef initialize_folder(folder_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Initializes a folder for output files.\n\n    Args:\n        self (object): The instance of the SchemaBuilder.\n        folder_name (str): The name of the folder to be created.
