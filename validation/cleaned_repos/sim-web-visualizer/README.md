# Web-Based Visualizer for Simulation Environments

This repository hosts a browser-based 3D viewer for physical simulators. It offers users the ability to observe simulations directly within their web browser, as an alternative to the default visualizer that comes with the simulator.

The main feature of this repo is that you only need to modify a server lines of your code to port the visualization on the default simulator viewer to the web visualizer. This feature is especially useful for visualizing simulation on a headless server. For example, train and visualize the IsaacGym tasks inside [jupyter notebook](example/isaacgym/train_isaacgym_remote_server.ipynb) on a remote server.
